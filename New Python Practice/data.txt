Program : set of Instruction

Language : universal medium of communication


low level language : language which a computer can understand
binary 
assembly
bytecode

high level language : langauge which user can understand -> special format(english based)
Programming language : Compiled
	c
	c++
	java
	c#
Scripting Language: interpreted
	javascript
	python

Compiler -> converts a high level into low level language(all the code as a single unit)
Interpreter -> converts a high level into low level language(line by line)

High level language : 
can be execute in two form
CUI based -> command user interface
GUI based -> graphical user interface
	IDE -> integrated devlopment environment
	application

Python IDE -> 
	IDLE
	PYCHARM
	JUPITER


C, C++ -> CodeBlocks
	DevC/C++
	TurboC/C++


a = 10
b = 20

Memory : storage space 
RAM : temporary(data can be changed)
ROM : Permanent(data cannot be changed)



RAM saves the input Data
Program -> define how that input data need to be processed by processor



Variable : a named RAM memory location which is used to save a data and this data can be changed
