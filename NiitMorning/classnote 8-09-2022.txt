Operator:
Relational Opeartors:
result will be in boolean format(True/False)

<
<=
>
>=
!=
==

10>2 		=> True

10>10 		=> False

10>=10 		=>True
10>10(False)
or
10==10(True)

10>=11		=>False
10>11(False)
or
10==11(False)


Logical Opeartors : when we want to check multiple expressions

and : result is True when  both the condition are true
or    : result is True when anyone of the condition is True
not  : result is True when condition is false and result is false when condition is true

age: 15 - 30

age>= 15  and  age<=30


A	B	And	Or
true	true	true	true
false	true	false	true
true	false	false	true
false	false	false	false


Conditional Contruct :

if ...else

if(condition):
	true code
else:
	false code
