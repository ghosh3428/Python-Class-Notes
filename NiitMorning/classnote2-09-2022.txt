PROGRAM :  set of instruction to perform a task


language:
Low level Language : which a computer can understand
binary
assembly
bytecode

High level Language : special format(english based) which developers can understand
Programming language : its a special format in which a developer will give the instruction

Compiler 	: convert a high level language into a low level language(convert all the codes as a single group)

Python : 
Syntax :

<variable name> = <data>

studentname = "Niit Jadavpur"
rollnumber = 123
totalmarks = 450
percentage = 90.0
grade = "A"


Datatype : type of data which can be saved in a variable

Primitive : single data
int -> whole numbers
float -> decimal numbers
str -> characters

Complex : group of data
sequence
tupple
list
set
dictionary


Calculations 
Opearator : special characters which performs a predefined task(basic math calculation or comparision)


Arithmetic : basic math calculation
can be used with number datatypes(int , float)

+	-> addition
-	-> subtraction
/	-> complete division
*	-> multiplication
%	-> remainder(modulas)
//	-> integer division
**	->power


Character
+	=> join the two characters
*	-> repeat
